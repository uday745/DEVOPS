how to install ansible?
 2 ways to install 
 i)pip install ansible (it is python module)
 ii)yum -y install ansible (before that you can install epel-release "yum -y install epel-release" and enable it)

 - localhost is my master

- create the master user private & public key 
- then place the master public key in  "authorized_keys" file
- cat id_rsa.pub--authorized_keys
- then copy key to nodes
- ssh-copy-id root@(nodeip)
- set nodes in master (/etc/ansible/hosts) file
